Super Nonogram does not collect any data about you (besides the data collected by third parties, see below). All progress is stored locally on your device, including what level you're currently on and the generated puzzles.

## Third party data collection

### Google Ads

Super Nonogram is free to download and play, and uses Google AdMob to display ads. AdMob may collect data about you, including your device's advertising ID, IP address, and location. You can read more about [how Google uses data from apps that use their services](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites).

When you first open Super Nonogram, you'll be shown a consent prompt asking you to choose between personalized and non-personalized ads. You can change this at any time by going to the settings menu in the game.

Note that ads are only used on the Android and iOS versions of Super Nonogram: other platforms (including the web) don't use any ads.
